# Changelog

2.0.0
- Updated to use bluebird 3.x and support node 5
- Removed Cancelation feature because Bluebird v3 changed it and I'm not quite sure how
  useful it even is in this project. (Note: if you need it back in, please open an issue with an
  idea of how you would like to see the api working)

1.0.0

- Initial release
